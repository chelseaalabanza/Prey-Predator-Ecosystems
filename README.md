# Prey-Predator Ecosystems
 
The project imitates a predation ecosystem wherein rabbits take the role as preys and snakes are to be considered to be their predators. The environment takes place on a grassland where the two animals reside and where rabbits can build up their energy by eating grass or carrots.

Rabbit Characteristic and Behaviors:
By default, rabbits initially start with 10 energy.
Every time they eat, they gain either 5 or 15 energy.
Once they reach 80 energy, they have a 50% chance to reproduce. 
Once a rabbit gives birth, they will hatch 2 rabbits.
Rabbits move erratically to avoid the snakes.
If rabbits move, they get -1 energy.
Rabbits die once they reach 0 energy.

Snake Characteristics and Behaviors:
By default, snakes initially start with 20 energy.
Every time they eat, they gain 10 energy.
Once they reach 150 energy, they have a 50% chance to reproduce. 
Once a snake gives birth, they will hatch 1 snake.
Snakes move faster than rabbits.
If snakes move, they get -1 energy.
Snakes die once they reach 0 energy.

Energy Source:
The regrowth rate of grass is 6% ticks while for carrots is 3%. 
Once the grass/carrot has been eaten, there is a 70% chance of grass to grow and 30% chance for carrots.
Grass gives 5 energy while carrots give 15 energy.
